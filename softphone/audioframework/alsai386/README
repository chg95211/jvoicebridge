This directory contains the necessary files to build libMediaFramework.so.
This library contains the native code for ALSA use by java.

You must have libasound2-dev installed:

sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev.

To build the library:

	- build the softphone
	- Then on a Linux machine (you must run this on a Linux 32-bit system!) type ./build.sh.


NOTE:  ON 5/18/2007 I modified /usr/include/jni.h to include linux/jni_md.h.

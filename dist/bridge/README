------------

The voice bridge is software written in the Java(TM) Programming Language that
handles Voice over IP (VoIP) audio communication and mixing for tasks such as 
conference calls, voice chat, speech detection, and audio for 3D virtual 
environments. The voice bridge supports a range of voice qualities from 
telephone to CD-quality. In addition, the voice bridge supports stereo audio
and the ability for each individual connected to the Bridge to have their own
private voice mix.

To run the voice bridge, use ant with the included run.xml file.  You can run
the voice bridge with the following command:

# ant -f run.xml

See the run.xml file for options of how to configure the voice bridge.

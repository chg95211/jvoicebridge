<h3><a name="JCA"></a>Contributor Agreement</h3><p>All contributors of source code, object code, documentation, orother materials must complete a Sun Contributor Agreement (SCA) formbefore any contributions can be included in the project. Print,complete, sign, scan and email the form to us: </p>

<ul><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/sca.pdf">Sun Contributor Agreement form</a> - 
Email to<a href="mailto:jVoiceBridge-sca@sun.com">jVoiceBridge-sca@sun.com</a>
</ul>
 
<p>The <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/contributor_agreement.jsp">SCA FAQ</a> provides more information about this form and the <a href="sca-approved.html">Contributor List</a> includes all individuals and organizations who have signed and submitted SCA forms.</p>
<h3>How You Can Contribute</h3><p>Here are some of the ways you can contribute to jVoiceBridge:</p><ul>  <li>    <p><b>Try out jVoiceBridge</b><br />You can download jVoiceBridge from the <a href="https://jvoicebridge.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">documents and files </a> page.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p><b>Participate on the Mailing List</b><br>The <a href="https://jvoicebridge.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">mailing lists</a>  provide a way for peopleusing the software to benefit from each other's expertise. To reallybe useful, these lists need <i>your</i> input! Please don't be afraidto post: help out others when you can, post your questions,comments and ideas as you see fit.   </li>  <li>    <p><b>File a Bug Report</b><br />Bug reports are very helpful to developers, and a great way tocontribute to a project. Please use the <a href="https://jvoicebridge.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a> to file bugs (defects). Remember to take a little time when filinga bug report; make sure you canreproduce the problem, and be very explicit in your description of theproblem. </p>  </li>  <li>    <p><b>File an Enhancement Request</b><br />If there's a feature you'd like to see and don't, orsomething you can imagine improving, let us know by filing anenhancement request. Use the <a href="https://jvoicebridge.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a> and filean "Enhancement" rather than a "Defect". </p>  </li>
  
  <li>    <p><b>Contributing Web Content, Documentation, or Translations</b><br />We welcome help in keeping the jVoiceBridge web content up-to-date. The easiest way to contribute content is to add to the <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Communications/jVoiceBridge">Wiki</a>. This is a light-weight process, but please send us a signed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/sca.pdf">Sun Contributor Agreement form</a> first. If you wish to add to, update, or translate the HTML content on the web site, please follow the procedure below for contributing code.     </p> </li>  
    <li>    <p><b>Contributing Code to jVoiceBridge</b><br />If there's a feature you'd like to see, or a bug you'd like to see fixed,you have the power to make that happen. In order to maintain the stability of the jVoiceBridge codebase, however, we have a contribution process that everyone, including Sun internal contributors, must follow.

<ol>
        <li>Complete a 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/sca.pdf">Sun Contributor Agreement form</a> and mail it back to us at <a href="mailto:jVoiceBridge-sca@sun.com">jVoiceBridge-sca@sun.com</a>. If you have already completed one of these forms as part of another open source project, please email us a pointer to that prior form. A signed agreement form is a legal requirement that must be met before we are permitted to accept any contributions.</li>
 
        <li><p>Use the <a href="https://jvoicebridge.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a> to file an Enhancement or Defect that describes the feature you plan to create or the bug you plan to fix, if an entry does not already exist for that feature or bug.</p>      </li>
      
      <li><p>Write your code in your own workspace. </p></li>
            <li><p>Return to your Enhancement or Defect in the <a href="https://jvoicebridge.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a> and submit a patch as an attachment.

         <li>An explanation of your enhancement
         <li>Some details on how it works
         </ul>

At this point, a core team member will be assigned to review your contribution. You will be given feedback on what changes, if any, are needed before the code can be accepted. Once a decision has been made to accept the contribution, the assigned core team member will integrate the patch.</p></li>      <li><p>Frequent contributors or sub-system owners will be invited to have Developer access to the workspace and to review code contributions from others.</p>      </li>    </ol>  </li></ul>

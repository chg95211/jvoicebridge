jVoiceBridge Connector
----------------------

The jVoiceBridge connector API provides a convenient API for connecting
to jVoiceBridge from Java programs.  The API allows you to place calls,
receive updates when a call's status changes, and manage many aspects of
the call, including private mixes.  See the included PlaceCall.java for
a basic example of how to use the bridge to place and monitor a call.

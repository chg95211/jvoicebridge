The programs in this directory were intended to help us understand and 
produce audio files as well as to analyze rtp packets.  

adjustVolume <linear or ulaw input / output file> <volumeFactor>

    Read and audio file adjust volume by <volumeFactor> and write back
    to the original file.

linear2ulaw <linear input file> <ulaw output file>

    Read the audio file <linear input file> and produce <ulaw output file>.

mix <file1> <file2> ...

    mix together the linear input files and write a linear output file
    to standard output.

rtpAnalyzer <raw snoop file> | <recording file>"
            [-to | -from <port>] [-checkRtp] [-au] [-rtp] [-speechDebug]

    The conference recording file is read and analyzed and a 
    histogram of times between packets is produced.

    If -au is specifed, an audio file will be produced.
    This can be played by audiotool.

seq <file1> <file2> ...

    concatenate the ulaw audio files and produce a ulaw output file.

ulaw.c

    library routines to convert between linear and ulaw.

ulaw2linear <ulaw input file> <linear output file>

    Read the audio file <ulaw input file> and produce <linear output file>
